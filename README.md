## Purpose of Futureworkz Playbook
Futureworkz is a company and like every company, Futureworkz needs profits in order to survive and grow. Futureworkz depends heavily on the people working in it in order to generate a sustainable profit.

This document attempts to describe how Futureworkz employee behaves together as an organization - how we think, how we talk, how we respond, etc. The main purpose is to align everyone in Futureworkz to work together, be happier and spend more meaningful time in work while producing a profit to sustain and grow the company.

We strongly encourage any employee of Futureworkz to improve this playbook by submitting a pull request (for coders) or raise an issue (for non-coders).

_This playbook is not made for you, it is made from you._

## How We Make Money?
We accumulate knowledge capital and skills in startup industry
in areas of marketing, UX design, IT development and technologies.

We then sell this knowledge and skills to clients
as business consultants, project management, design and development.

Through this cycle of learning and applying,
we grow into Asia thought leaders and a world class development firm.

Clients will then naturally engage us over other competitors despite our premium fees.

## Who We Are
> ### ar·ti·san 
>   _noun_  
>   a worker in a skilled trade, especially one that involves making things by hand.

We are no different from a coffee barista or a carpenter who rely on their skill and experiences to create a beautiful and functional coffee or chair for their customer.

We create web/mobile app through our Agile thinking, coding and design craftsmanship.
We are craftsmen, creators, partners, consultants and sometimes saviors to our clients.
The final product launched on the web or in mobile store represents who we are and our craftsmanship.

We are app artisan.

## Vision
To be a happy software development firm  
with happy employees  
for happy customers  
by happy bosses

## Learning Culture
As our industry is a fast learning and ever-changing industry, a learning culture between management, staff and client is a necessity to our survival.

Learning is not just accumulating knowledge. We apply them, experiment them, play with them until we understand them. A learning culture is not just a culture with lots of presentations to attend. It also encompass the curiosity to experiment and the dare-ness to fail.

Management has the understanding that mistakes must be made in order to learn new things while employees take the initiatives to learn, experiment and share new things in Futureworkz.

While we have our daily work and deadlines to meet, we strive to learn on the job (eg. trying a new Ruby gem) or spend after-work time (eg. attend a Ruby Meetup) to advance ourselves.

We also constantly strive to present what we have learned so that others may benefit from us.

## Organisation Culture
### Curious and dare to try new things
There is always a better and newer thing in the Internet. We should not stay entrenched in yesterday’s thinking. It is okay in Futureworkz to try something new and fail horribly. In fact, we know that most of the time, the newer things will probably fail but that once in every while, we will find something that is really great!

### Learn and share with each other
We are active learners and do not shy from anything new. We also recognise that the best way to learn is to teach. Through teaching, we share our knowledge. We are not afraid that our knowledge is wrong or too low. We are only afraid that our mind is closed from learning.

### Strive to be the best in the world
Without vision, we are lost. In whatever we do, we always strive towards being the best in the world. We love best practices, best ideas, best methods, etc. We actively research and adopt best-er practices in our work to improve our skills.

### Disciplined
No knowledge in the world is useful until it can be applied. To apply knowledge, we need discipline in our work and in our life. While we can be crazy and unorthodox in our thinking, we exert discipline in our execution and conduct.

## Common Working Behaviors
To give you a better sense of how we work in Futureworkz, here's some things you can do:
- Things are always changing internally due to improvements, so get used to new ways of working

## Project Engagement Rule
Futureworkz will only engage a project if
- the project will enhance our reputation in the industry
- the project enhance our knowledge capital in terms of implementing new technologies
- the project pays us at least SGD 3000 per week

## Project Development and Management
We use Agile eXtreme Programming (XP) to run our projects.
Coder will be assisted by AE to communicate directly with the client and complete the project.
PM will oversee all projects and mainly to provide outside scope communication and consultation to client.

We see PM and AE as the interim solution to reach our ideal XP goal - where every coder can manage the project, code and even provide consultations directly with the client alone.

Our ultimate goal is to create XP coders who are not just able to deliver superb coding but also able to manage a project independently and directly with the client and also to provide consultation to the client.

## Staff Working Integrity
As client pays us by time, it is important that we demonstrate the integrity of our development time in order to avoid disputes such as whether our coder is working or not.

We use HubStaff.com to monitor every coder’s working computer to ensure our working hours are fully devoted to the client’s project.

To prove our integrity, we allow client to view our coder’s screen upon request.

## Sustainable Development and Working
We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers.

Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes. Working overnight destroy productivity, happiness and quality. Why should we produce low quality product for our clients?

## Coding Standard
We have high regards for code quality in Futureworkz. We would rather spend more time to develop a better quality codes than rushing for more codes and for more features.

Our minimum coding standards are:
###Test driven development
We don’t have test case for everything but we definitely have test cases to cover critical parts of the application. Test cases ensure that our app is working and without bugs whenever we introduce new features into it. Test cases also gives us the affordance to refactor and improve our code quality. With refactoring, we learn better coding practices and improve ourselves as a coder.

### Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
We remove any duplications in our code, files and any other relevant stuff. Duplication is a consequence of lazy and untidy coding style. It is a mark of messy mind. We should be disciplined to refactor our code to remove duplications so as to ensure that our code is clean and easy to read.


### Naming Reveals Intention
Ruby is an amazingly expressive programming language. We avoid using comments in our code and instead, let our code be clear enough to express what it does. Ruby allows us to do this and we should make full use of it. We put deliberation into the naming of our variables, classes, files, methods, etc so that it expresses what it does clearly. This distills our intention in our code and create better quality code.

### Single Responsibility Principle
Every class and method should only do one thing. We should not lump every logic and responsibility into a God class or a super method. This makes code difficult to understand and hard to change.

### Others
This is never meant to be an exhaustive list. Code quality is a life-long pursue. We strive to learn more about refactoring, design patterns and workflows to improve our skills.

## Problem Resolution
If stuck, google by yourself for 10 mins.
If no solution found, ask someone.
If a solution is found, implement it but don’t waste more than 30 minutes to implement the solution (it may not be the correct solution)
If you found a really great solution, share it!

## 12 Steps Development Flow For Coders
We follow a simple step-by-step flow to complete our project:
- Clarify story requirements and start the story in Pivotal Tracker
- Break into steps
- Write test case for a step
- Write the passing code
- Refactor the code
- Run full rspec
- Commit the code (in development branch)
- Repeat step 3 until the story is completed
- Merge into master and checkout development
- Push to staging and mark story as deliver
- Test staging
- Mark story as completed

## Intellectual Property Security
Client hires us to develop their best ideas. We should ensure that the code and other intellectual properties are not leaked to the public or worse, client’s competitors.

Some basic rules we practise are:
- Never push project source code to public repository
- We can share snippets of code but not all of the code with other parties
- We can discuss what we learn with others but never reveal exactly how it works
